branch WP2 has code for the Oct. 2020 version of WP
this branch  uses a two step approach, holding the covariance
matrix fixed at the estimate at the initial consistent estimator. This is faster,
and works fine. Also, focus only on the GMM form, and on the NN estimator. This saves time, as the 
questions about the other versions are answered by the WP. Have added a mixture of normals example
and a jump diffusion empirical example.
