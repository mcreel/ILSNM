This directory holds an example of estimation of the jump diffusion model 
![model](https://github.com/mcreel/SNM/blob/master/examples/JD/SimulationEstimation/model.png)

using data on S&P500 returns from Dec. 2013 - Dec. 2017. 
The data is ![returns](https://github.com/mcreel/SNM/blob/master/examples/JD/SP500/returns.svg)

The results are in the .svg files. For example, for the parameter tau, the standard deviation
of measurement error in observed returns, the marginal posterior is
is in the following figure, where we see that it is quite likely that there is measurement error.
