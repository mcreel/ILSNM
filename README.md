This archive contains the code for the examples reported in the working paper <a href=https://www.barcelonagse.eu/research/working-papers/inference-using-simulated-neural-moments>Inference using simulated neural moments</a>. The code in the WP branch of this archive holds the code for the continuously updating version, for the SV, ARMA and DPD examples. This code was used in the first version of the working paper. The WP2 branch holds the original code for the newer JD and Auction examples, and was used for the revised version of the working paper, which is what the link above points to. 

The master branch holds the development code, which is used for the examples that will appear in the next revision of the paper.

There is a registered Julia package "SimulatedNeuralMoments" which allows convenient use of the methods. The code in the master branch of this archive uses this package for the examples.
