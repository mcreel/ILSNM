Since the WP, the newer code uses a two step approach, holding the covariance
matrix fixed at the estimate at the initial consistent estimator. This is faster,
and works fine.

Also, focus only on the GMM form, and on the NN estimator. This saves time, as the 
questions about the other versions are answered by the WP.

Have added a mixture of normals example, and now working on adding a jump diffusion.
